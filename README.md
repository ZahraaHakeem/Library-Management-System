# Library-Management-System
This was the final project for the "Python Programming Language" course which is part of the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence major study plan in UCAS with Dr. Shadi Abu Dalfa

The attached file in PDF will explain to you the requirements of the project, which is, in short, a system for managing a library, including various operations such as:

1. Print books info

2. Search a book

3. Add new book

4. Remove a book

5. Borrow a book

6. Return a book

I used the basics of Python to build this project such as:

  -Different types of data

  -Decisions

  -Loops

  -Functions

  -Sets and Dictionaries

  -Files and Exceptions Handling



Note:

Using the principles of inheritance will make it easier to build the project, but I did not use them based on the instructions of my teacher
